## 🏗️ Building

A `c++17`-compiler as well as `libcurl` is needed.

Compile it just by
```
make
```

## 🚫 Missing Features

Are any features missing? If so, just [ask for it in an Issue!](https://github.com/lquenti/dict.cc/issues).

## ❓❓❓ Why would you use C++ out of all great languages ❓❓❓

Solely for the joke of naming it `dict.cc`. I don't even like C++ at all.
